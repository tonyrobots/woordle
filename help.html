        <p>Welcome to Worderly! The goal is to guess the hidden word.</p>

        <p>
          When you guess a word, you receive feedback on each letter. It's like
          Wordle, but with a twist -- the clues relate to where each letter in
          the answer falls alphabetically in relation to your guess.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="correct">A</span>: Correct letter in the correct
            position.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="aft">B</span>: The correct letter for this position
            comes after your guess in the alphabet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bef">Z</span>: The correct letter for this position
            comes before your guess in the alphabet.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use this feedback to narrow down the possibilities and guess the word!
